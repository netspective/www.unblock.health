<h2><span>Q.</span> We already have a patient portal. Why would we need Unblock Health?</h2>
<p>Most patient portals fall short of meeting patient's daily requests with respect to medical record requests. Unblock Health helps healthcare delivery organizations (HDOs) and providers become instantly more consumer and patient-centric by reducing Patient Administrative Burden due to manual processes. UH is intentionally EHR agnostic. We reduce the fragmentation of HDO and provider digital front doors while supporting Information Blocking Rules compliance. Also, our system allows HDOs and providers to always engage patients when they are ready to request their health information, not only during business hours.</p>

<h2><span>Q.</span> All of our medical records request information is on our website. Why would we need Unblock Health?</h2>
<p>Most websites are often missing most of the information and tools patients need to fulfill their requests. Patients and family members may need to search for phone numbers of different departments, like radiology, billing, or pathology, for different aspects of their records request. Patients may need to download and print numerous forms as well and hunt for return addresses and fax numbers. It shouldn’t be this complicated! Unblock Health can easily replace this status quo with a streamlined, transparent, digital, easy-to-use process that brings peace of mind to health information management (HIM) professionals and patients.</p>

<h2><span>Q.</span> Patients don’t understand or care about access to their medical records. They don’t even log into their patient portals. Why would we invest in Unblock Health?</h2>
<p>Patients have a right to their medical records; it is not a matter of opinion as to whether they understand or care about their records. Patients have a right to access and inspect their records. Healthcare providers are the actors that lead in the numbers of potential Information Blocking claims filed against them by a landslide as compared to other actors. It is possible that patients don’t use their patient portals due to the lack of actionable information that has traditionally been available to patients. </p>
<p>As of October 6, 2022, the Information Blocking Rules now extend to all electronic health information (EHI). Unblock Health is an asset to supporting healthcare delivery organizations and providers in meeting patients’ needs while preventing Information Blocking complaints and consequent investigations and penalties.</p>

<h2><span>Q.</span> Is Unblock Health a personal health record (PHR)? Does Unblock Health collect and house patient medical records?</h2>
<p>No, Unblock Health is a SaaS that transforms the Medical Records Request and Medical Records Correction Request processes. We are not a PHR. We do not house or store any patient medical records. We do not pull records on a patient’s behalf. We are the conduit for seamless requests that are efficient, fully documented, and compliant with regulations. We respect the wishes of patients and consumers who do not wish to have a 3rd party involved in aggregating their records but simply demand for a more modernized process in self-requesting records. Unblock Health is that conduit and solution.</p>

<h2><span>Q.</span> Our medical records department is too small/too understaffed to implement a new system.</h2>
<p>Unblock Health is intentionally designed to support providers and organizations both big and small. There is greater benefit to organizations and providers who are understaffed and are working with limited resources as the meticulous design and strategic workflows that have been incorporated arm health information managers with a tool that helps them work more efficiently and at a greater scale. Unblock Health will decrease the number of:</p>

<h2><span>Q.</span> Is this really a tool designed for patients to use directly?</h2>
<p>YES! Patients frequently run into challenges when acquiring their medical records and health information. There is currently no way to track and document the often tedious, back and forth process of gathering one's information. From endless phone calls, faxes, voicemails, handwritten requests dropped off in person, to requests being left unaddressed, Unblock Health is committed to putting an end to the insanity with our technology.</p>

<h2><span>Q.</span> Will patients be charged for using Unblock Health?</h2>
<p>While we are currently in start-up mode, the working model will be that funding will come from healthcare delivery organizations and providers that are responsible for medical records and patient access as Unblock Health will be automating & streamlining their work. Unblock Health will be available to health systems and providers on a monthly or annual subscription basis.</p>

<h2><span>Q.</span> Why do we need a tool like Unblock Health if HIPAA violations can be reported to Office of Civil Rights (OCR)?</h2>
<p>When you have a chronic illness, a life altering diagnosis like cancer, or a personal emergency, you need access to your or your loved one's records NOW. Patients and their carepartners need a way to hold the system accountable when there is clear data blocking. Filing a report with OCR is a way to report a violation however it does not keep the violator(s) accountable in real-time to give you access to your records or information. Unblock Health is committed to providing patients and their carepartners with a way to change information blocking.</p>

<h2><span>Q.</span> Will Unblock Health be able to integrate into existing systems?</h2>
<p>Yes! The goal is for Unblock Health to integrate so no one has to do any manual work. When Unblock Health cannot integrate into a system, it's because an organization or provider does not want to.</p>

<h2><span>Q.</span> How can my organization stay up-to-date on the latest policies and regulations to ensure compliance as well as to prevent information blocking?</h2>
<p>Information blocking is not only against the law, it can negatively impact patient safety and patient care. Unblock Health offers personalized training and educational sessions to address all real-world information blocking issues. Inquire about our training sessions today.</p>

<h2><span>Q.</span> Should errors in medical records be corrected?</h2>
<p>With increased access to their medical records, more and more patients are finding errors and gaps in information upon reviewing their medical records. It is critically important to have these errors flagged and corrected as soon as possible as these errors and gaps can negatively impact coordination of care, treatment planning, patient safety, informed decision making, and even clinical trial enrollment. Unblock Health provides patients with a way to immediately address medical record addendums where they are in a systematic manner. No more hand-written or verbal addendum record requests!</p>

<h2><span>Q.</span> Does Unblock Health review, rate, or vet third-party apps which may serve as a personal health record (PHR) or patient access solution?</h2>
<p>No. Unblock Health is not a standardization, certification, or vetting authority for patient access technologies but rather a software solutions provider, policy shaper, and patient access educator. If you are an innovator with such an app or solution, you may consider reaching out to <a href="https://www.medigy.com/" target="_blank">Medigy</a>, a platform that allows for the community to conduct peer reviews and vetting by way of a crowd-sourcing model.
