## Purpose of Notice
Our purpose in providing this is to provide transparency about the privacy and security aspects of individual information of Individual Access Services (IAS) as may be necessary to inform potential IAS users of the terms of IAS. This IAS privacy and security notice should be read in conjunction with all other terms and information concerning IAS. In the event of any conflict between that information and this notice, this notice will control.

## Where to Find the Current Notice and Future Updates
This Privacy and Security Notice for IAS is posted for public display at [https://www.unblock.health/individual-access-services/](https://www.unblock.health/individual-access-services/). We may update this notice at any time. Updates will take effect on their posting dates. All updates will be posted at the web address. We also notify IAS users of material updates from time to time.

## How We Approach Privacy and Security
IAS is a means for obtaining protected health care information from a nationwide network for the private and secure exchange of health care information.The nationwide network adopted security standards of Trusted Exchange Framework Common Agreement (TEFCA), and IAS is required to adhere to particular TEFCA standards.Only by our adherence to the standards are we permitted to provide access to health information on the network.  

Under TEFCA principles, we do not assume consent is given on the basis of registration by an IAS user alone, and we send this notice to provide information that potential IAS users may want to consider in choosing whether to consent and use IAS or refuse to consent and not use IAS.We intend this notice to be a transparent mention of the factors a potential IAS may consider important. We welcome questions and requests from potential IAS users.   

To obtain clarification or request more information, address our Privacy Department at **privacy@unblock.health**. 

Individuals who are IAS users or potential IAS users should address complaints regarding the privacy policies described in this notice by email addressed to our Privacy Department at **privacy@unblock.health**.

Our user-facing IAS application will identify a department or an Individual to contact who can respond to questions or complaints.

We document each privacy-related complaint, our related communications and the disposition of each privacy complaint.

## Why We Need and Request an Individual User’s Individually Identifying Information
For providing IAS, we need to request each IAS user’s individually identifiable information for purposes of establishing that the information request is authentically the IAS user’s request with the health care information network and participants in it.  For IAS, we limit disclosure to the disclosure of encrypted information that can be compared with individual information held and believed authentic by a relevant TEFCA network participant.

## Individual Information Is Never Sold
We do not sell or exchange the information an IAS user sends or receives with IAS.  The IAS user’s individual information and health care information is encrypted (not readable) while in transit to or from us and at all times while at rest. 

The IAS user is given the sole power to control who can receive and ultimately decrypt and read the information. Decryption occurs when the IAS user or a designate recipient of encrypted TEFCA information uses a means to unencrypt (in order to read) the information.  The term TEFCA information ceases to apply to the decrypted information. If received by the IAS user, TEFCA does not impose any requirements or limitations on the information after the user obtains it. Health care organizations follow information privacy and security standards imposed by HIPAA and the HIPAA Privacy Rule, and they are subject also to TEFCA as to TEFCA information while it is TEFCA information (encrypted). Our obligations under this notice will continue for as long as the TEFCA information survives in accordance with section 10.6 of the Common Agreement.

## No Claims Against IAS Users
Under TEFCA, we can never assert any sort of claim against an IAS user with respect to information sent, received or shared through the network of healthcare information (TEFCA information) even if we were able to access, exchange, use, or disclose it. Notwithstanding that system records may also refer to TEFCA information, we may use system records to calculate and claim usage fees or charges if necessary.

## Consent and Controlled Sharing of TEFCA Information
TEFCA Information may not be accessed, exchanged, used, and disclosed to third parties by us without the consent of the IAS user. We obtain that consent when an IAS user gives us instructions to share or receive TEFCA information.

We from time to time use service providers who do so on condition of accepting and performing the same obligations that we undertake to protect individually identifiable information and all TEFCA information.

Also, TEFCA information might be seen incidentally in audit logs, which we use only for the normal permitted purposes of audit logs.

## Involuntary Disclosures May Occur
We cannot assure against all kinds of involuntary disclosure, such as third parties may seek to compel our disclosure of TEFCA information, and we may be required to do so unless we successfully oppose such efforts in each case.

To the extent that any person holds TEFCA Information, the person may receive legal demands, including subpoenas or court orders (“Legal Compulsion”) seeking disclosure of TEFCA information.  Legal Compulsion may call for disclosure of any TEFCA information, which may include the information related to an IAS user’s reproductive health care, pregnancy, termination of pregnancy, or gender-affirming care, even if the IAS user paid for those health care services. See **"Objecting to Compulsory Disclosure of TEFCA Information"** below.  

## Cyber Threats
Third parties may seek to compromise the privacy and security of IAS unless our efforts, or efforts of the IAS user, succeed in preventing such legal outcome in each case.

## Period of Time We Retain the TEFCA Information
We hold TEFCA information only from the time from receiving it until shortly after delivering as instructed by the relevant IAS users.

Once the requested exchange is complete, TEFCA Information (TI) is securely deleted or rendered inaccessible, except as required in the following limited cases:  

  - **Temporary Retention for Delivery Integrity:** TI may be briefly retained in encrypted form to confirm successful transmission and troubleshoot delivery errors.
  - **Audit Logs and Security Monitoring:** TI may appear in system audit logs or monitoring records as required by the TEFCA Common Agreement. Such information is accessible only for audit, compliance, or security purposes and not for secondary use.
  - **Legal or Regulatory Requirements:** If law, regulation, or valid legal process requires retention, we may retain TI in encrypted form for as long as legally mandated.

## No De-Identification
We will never de-identify electronic health care information of IAS users because de-identified data cannot serve any of the intended purposes of IAS.

## Which Individually Identifiable Information Is Collected for IAS
Types of Data We May Collect:

We ask IAS users for proof of identity such as typically contained in birth certificates, official identification documents, and medical benefits cards. 

## Other Information We Request
We request IAS users to indicate a preferred email address and mailing address for receiving communications from us concerning IAS from time to time in our discretion.

We ask IAS users how they prefer to receive our electronic communications, which may change from time to time. Promptly after IAS users indicate a preference or change in preference, our future IAS communications to the IAS user will be attempted according to the latest preferences as indicated.

We ask IAS users to disclose an email address, first name and last name, one or more physical and mailing addresses, one or more phone numbers, and other information we may request in the reasonable exercise of our discretion. Some information is used for authenticating the IAS user’s identity across the health information network.

Authorized representatives of the individual are asked to disclose information concerning authority as well as identification for access control.

## Our Automatic Data Collection
We automatically collect usage data, Internet Protocol (i.e. IP) addresses, browser type, browser version, time and date, elapsed time, unique device identifiers and other similar data from each device used by IAS users to access IAS.

## Disclosures through TEFCA
All disclosures we make through TEFCA are in accordance with the permitted and required uses and disclosures specified in the Common Agreement and applicable U.S. Department of Health and Human Services guidance.

## TEFCA Applies in Addition to Any Applicable HIPAA Requirements
TEFCA requirements are in addition to all HIPAA requirements that may apply to the participants in TEFCA. We follow the HIPAA Privacy Rule.

Under our service agreements, we may agree to perform the obligations that HIPAA and the HIPAA Rules establish for a "business associate" of a "covered entity".

## Objecting to Compulsory Disclosure of TEFCA Information
Under certain circumstances, we may be legally required to disclose individually identifiable information in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g., a court or a government agency).

Unless prohibited by applicable law, we will provide written notice to affected IAS users within three (3) business days after receiving notice of any such demand. IAS users may exercise any available rights under law or equity, such as to object to production or to obtain a protective order. Such efforts would be at the sole cost of such IAS user absent an agreement to the contrary.

## Notice of Disclosure of TEFCA Information
We will provide written notice to affected IAS users within three (3) business days after making that IAS user's individually identifiable information available to any law enforcement agency except if in that instance the law prohibits us from giving notice to the IAS user.

## TEFCA Privacy and Security Standards
Under TEFCA, we are required to act in accordance with section 10 of the Common Agreement and accordingly protect the security of the information we hold in the manner described therein.

We devote commercially reasonable efforts to protecting individually identifiable information from any unauthorized or illegal access, modification, use, or destruction.

**Encryption**

Every bit of individually identifiable information we hold is encrypted when received, while in transit, and while at rest.

**Notification of Security Incidents**

As part of our constant commitment to privacy and security, we must notify IAS users in accordance with the Common Agreement if their information is affected by a security incident involving us.

**We select service providers with great care**
We require third-party services to agree to the same standards and practices that we follow.

We limit access permissions to the minimum necessary for a permitted purpose.

We monitor our systems.

We cannot and do not permit service providers to decrypt TEFCA data

## This Notice is Provided in Advance of Consent
We enforce a requirement that all IAS users express written consent to the terms of this notice, as then in effect, prior to the IAS users access, exchange, use or disclosure of the IAS user's TEFCA Information, except only disclosures that are required by law.

IAS users are advised to read and understand this notice because it describes the context and consequences of giving consent and using IAS.

We may be required to obtain an IAS user's consent again if we make changes to this notice that materially changes our collection or use of individually identifiable information.

We may obtain IAS users' consent via electronic signatures as permitted in the E-Sign Act.

We maintain a secured, auditable log that is sufficient to validate and verify the consents.

## How to Revoke Consent to this Notice
Consent may be revoked by logging into IAS and using the **"Opt-Out"** option available in the account settings of the Unblock Health platform. Once an opt-out request is submitted, the IAS user’s access to IAS services will be discontinued.

Revocation of consent cannot affect any actions taken by us in reliance on the consent prior to the date of such revocation. 

Subsequent to such revocation, the IAS user will no longer be able to login or access any IAS provided through us. IAS user must authenticate to establish a right of access each time access is requested.
