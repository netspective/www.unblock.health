The healthcare system is not designed to serve patients. It may have started out that way, but it’s best we confront or current reality.

That’s not to say that the people working inside of this industry are bad. Not at all. Some of the best, most generous, and caring people I’ve ever met work in healthcare. Unfortunately, they, like the patients they serve, are merely inputs to a complex national healthcare system that’s evolved to serve itself and its ever-growing appetite for trillions of American dollars.

I don’t blame anyone for this. If you look at the history of how the system evolved, it makes a ton of sense that we’ve ended up here. And I’m encouraged by some of the emerging trends in the industry to pay for value, coordinate care and address the social determinants of health (SDOH). We’ll get better, but it’ll take time.

In the meantime, what will I do if I or one of my loved ones gets sick? Like really, chronically sick where we need tight coordination across teams of caregivers from many organizations right now?
